    "Reply": "Exposure to aggressive or unpredictable parental behavior can contribute to the development of stress responses and heightened sensitivity to similar triggers later in life. Behavioral conditioning and learned associations may result in avoidance behaviors or anxiety in response to comparable stimuli.

I ended up with B\u2019s, which I honestly thought were good, but my dad keeps saying that because I didn\u2019t get all A\u2019s now, my grades will \u201conly get worse\u201d as classes get harder. Hearing that over and over has gotten in my head. Logically I know B\u2019s aren\u2019t bad, especially for the first quarter, but a lot of my friends got straight A\u2019s and it\u2019s making me feel like there\u2019s something wrong with me. I\u2019m trying not to compare myself, but it\u2019s hard when the people around me and at home act like anything less than perfect means I\u2019m failing. I guess I just need some reassurance from people who\u2019ve been through college. Am I actually doing okay? Is it normal to not get perfect grades right away? I really want to believe I\u2019m capable of making it, but right now I could just use someone telling me that I\u2019m not already falling behind.",
